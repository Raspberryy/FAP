This programm is using some terminal included commands and programms, such as airbase-ng or sslstrip.
Make sure that your Kali Linux OS is updated ( sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade)

To run this programm you have to open up a new terminal and navigate to the downloaded folder (cd /filepath/to/folder). Then simply type "python wel.py".

If it doesn't work, you maybe have to restart your computer. 

NOTE: This programm still has some bugs, which need to be fixed!  
       - After you have turned the python programm off, you can't run it again without restarting your pc.
       - The programm doens't disable the monitor-mode automaticaly
       - There is no exit --> Just close the terminals
